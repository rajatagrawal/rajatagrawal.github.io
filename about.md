I am Rajat. I grew up in India. I did a Bachelors in Information and Communication Technology from Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gujarat, India. Then I came to USA to pursue a Masters in Human Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.

I work at Case Commons, Inc. Case Commons is a non-profit tech startup in Midtown Manhattan. Before Case Commons, I worked at Panasonic Research and Development in Cupertino, CA. There I developed multimedia applications for next-generation interactiion techniques in a car dashboard. I developed software for drivers to be able to make hand gesture to perform tasks with the help of finger recognition camera. These application prototypes were presented at Detroit Motor Show in Jan, 2012

Before Panasonic, I worked with Bank of America. I worked on prototyping and researching ways customers can interact with customer care in day to day life. The focus of the project was to develop video enabled customer care services for mobile devices. The findings of this prototype research have been patented in the form of 6 patents in USA and is also used in ATMS of BofA.
